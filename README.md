## Rs-Ui
Rs-Ui is a design	system for building user interfaces in React. 
It provides a set of components that helps developers create consistent and visually appealing user interfaces quickly and efficiently.
The purpose of the prototype is to demonstrate my proficiency in React and design principles, as well as to showcase my ability to create reusable components that can be easily integrated into any project.
